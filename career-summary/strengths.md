# Core Strengths & Competencies

## 🛠️ Technical Mastery

### Full-Stack Versatility
**Breadth:** MERN → .NET → ElasticSearch → AI/LLM → Grammar Engineering → Geospatial  
**Depth:** Not just "full-stack"—I go deep into each layer
- **Backend:** Node.js (Lambda), .NET Core, Java/Spring Boot, Python/Django
- **Frontend:** React, Svelte, StencilJS (Micro Frontends), Flutter
- **Data:** ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL (PostGIS), Oracle, DynamoDB, Redis
- **Messaging:** Kafka, Kinesis, Pulsar, RabbitMQ, SQS
- **Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, ECS, Kinesis, CloudTrail, Config), Azure

**Example:** At H&B, went from MERN developer to .NET/ElasticSearch expert on OneSearch. At Openlane, transitioned from Node.js backend to full-stack React/Svelte.

### Cloud-Native Architecture
**AWS Expertise:**
- Event-driven pipelines (Kinesis → Lambda → DynamoDB)
- Security hardening (IAM, MFA, CloudTrail, Config, VPC isolation)
- Cost optimization (eliminated 100TB storage, recovered from $500K hack)

**Example:** At Openlane, architected Classic Integration Service processing millions of OGG events across 100+ Kinesis topics with Five 9s uptime.

### AI & LLM Integration
**Practical AI, Not Research:**
- Content moderation (Gemini API for Q&A filtering)
- Medical summarization (GPT-4 for patient logs)
- Prompt engineering for edge cases ("five five five" = phone number)

**Example:** Self-initiated AI moderation at Openlane reduced arbitration by 20%, saved $50k/year—praised by VP.

### Security Expertise
**Production-Grade Security Implementation:**
- IAM least-privilege policies, MFA enforcement
- CloudTrail logging, AWS Config compliance rules
- Multi-token authentication (Okta, JWT, Service tokens)
- Audit trails for HIPAA compliance

**Example:** Solo recovery from $500K AWS hack at FoodMesh—implemented comprehensive security hardening, convinced AWS to cancel charges.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
**Not Just Writing Tests—TDD Discipline:**
- Write failing tests first, then implement
- 60%+ code coverage on OneSearch (H&B)
- Confidence to refactor aggressively

**Example:** On OneSearch, I wrote the majority of the test suite, translating business requirements to use cases before any feature was built.

### Domain-Specific Languages (DSL)
**Grammar Engineering:** Designed Antlr4-based promotion DSL at H&B
- Defined grammar for business rules
- Built visual UI for non-technical users
- Compiler generates executable C# code

**Example:** Promo DSL reduced setup time by 90%, drove $2M revenue, adopted company-wide.

### Geospatial Engineering
**PostGIS Expertise:**
- Optimized spatial queries from 2s to <50ms
- Haversine distance calculations at scale
- Real-time geospatial matching

**Example:** FoodMesh charity matching—"Find charities within 10km with capacity for 50kg" in <50ms.

- **$500K CAD:** Recovered from AWS hack (FoodMesh)
- **$50K/year:** AI moderation reduced manual ops costs (Openlane)

**Trade-off Thinking:** I don't just optimize for tech elegance—I optimize for business value.

### Revenue Generation
**Driving Top-Line Growth:**
- **$2M/year:** Promo DSL increased frequency (H&B)
- **15% conversion uplift:** OneSearch latency reduction (H&B)
- **Mobile app:** Enabled auction participation → bid volume increase (Openlane)

**Example:** I frame every technical decision in business terms: latency → conversion, self-service → engineering cost savings.

### Compliance & Regulatory
**Operating Under Legal Constraints:**
- **Brexit:** 2 years of evolving regulations, zero violations (H&B)
- **HIPAA:** Architected compliant RTM platform (Rheumera)
- **Hard Deadlines:** Miss = fines or blocked sales

**Example:** Worked with Legal/Compliance teams to translate regulations into technical requirements (tenant architecture, audit logs).

### ROI-Driven Decision Making
**Always Calculate the Return:**
- Gemini API cost ($365/year) vs. manual moderation savings ($50k/year) = 137x ROI
- AWS SDK v3 migration: proactive (no fire drill) + 20% performance gain

## 🚀 Innovation & Creative Problem-Solving

### Outside-the-Box Solutions
**Not Just "Build a Feature"—Solve the Real Problem:**
1. **Determinable UUIDs:** Instead of storing 100TB of mappings, compute them on-the-fly (Openlane)
2. **Antlr4 DSL:** Instead of engineers writing SQL, empower marketing with a visual rule builder (H&B)
3. **Dual-Run Comparison:** Instead of guessing search parity, measure it precisely (H&B)

### Self-Initiated Projects
**Doesn't Wait to Be Told:**
- **AI Moderation (Openlane):** Saw the problem, built POC, got it approved
- **Promo DSL (H&B):** Pulled into team, proposed creative solution
- **SOLID Principles Sessions (H&B):** Taught the team, refactored legacy code

**Pattern:** I identify business pain, propose solutions, and deliver.

---

## 👥 Leadership & Team Building

### Mentorship
**Leveling Up Engineers:**
- **2 engineers to promotion (Rheumera):** Code reviews, architectural guidance, weekly sessions
- **SOLID Principles Teaching (H&B):** Brown-bag sessions, live refactoring
- **TDD Advocate (H&B):** Taught test-first approach, increased team adoption

**Philosophy:** Mentorship isn't "telling people what to do"—it's teaching them *how to think*.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration
**Bridge Engineer Between Teams:**
- **Openlane:** Worked across 10-15 teams (SRE, Product, QA, Platform)
- **H&B:** Contributed to 4 teams (CMS, Search, Promo, Data)
- **Stakeholders:** Legal (Brexit), AWS (security), Product (OneSearch), Marketing (Promo)

**Skill:** Translate tech → business language. Legal doesn't care about ElasticSearch; they care about compliance deadlines.

### Influence Without Authority
**How to Get Things Done Without Being a Manager:**
- **Propose, Don't Demand:** AI moderation wasn't on roadmap; I built POC, showed value
- **Document & Teach:** SOLID sessions built cultural capital
- **Overdeliver:** Promo team wanted "a better way"; I delivered a DSL with UI

**Result:** Became the "go-to" person for hard problems across multiple teams.

## 🔥 Crisis Management & Solo Ownership

### Operating Under Pressure
**Career-Defining Crises:**
1. **$500K AWS Hack (FoodMesh):** Solo technical person, company survival at stake—recovered platform, saved $500K
2. **2-Week Android Sprint (Openlane):** Marketing committed to launch; delivered 10+ features flawlessly
3. **Brexit Compliance (H&B):** 2 years of weekly requirement changes, zero violations

**Trait:** Calm under pressure. Focus on mitigation first, root cause second.

### Solo Ownership
**When There's No One Else:**
- **FoodMesh:** Only tech person during $500K security crisis
- **Rheumera:** Lead engineer, owned entire backend architecture
- **H&B Promo DSL:** Co-architect (with 1 other dev)

**Difference:** Most engineers work on distributed teams. I've owned entire systems solo—forces you to make high-stakes decisions confidently.

## ⚡ Execution Excellence

### Shipping Velocity
**Multiple Projects Simultaneously:**
- **Openlane:** NewWave SDK + Classic Integration + IAM + Futurestack migration—all in parallel
- **H&B:** OneSearch + Brexit compliance + Promo DSL + Data POC—across 4 teams

**How:** Prioritization, context switching, documentation so others can continue without me.

### Zero-Downtime Migrations
**Strangler Fig Pattern Expert:**
- **OneSearch (H&B):** Oracle → ElasticSearch, phased rollout (5% → 100%), zero downtime
- **Openlane Microservices:** Oracle → .NET, seamless cutover
- **AWS SDK v2 → v3 (Openlane):** Proactive migration, no production issues

**Philosophy:** Big-bang rewrites fail. Incremental migrations with safety nets win.

### Phased Rollouts & Risk Mitigation
**Don't Ship to 100% on Day 1:**
- **OneSearch:** 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%, with rollback capability
- **AI Moderation:** Async processing + human fallback for low-confidence scores

**Mindset:** Optimize for failure recovery, not just success scenarios.

## 🗣️ Communication & Stakeholder Management

### Translating Tech → Business
**Speak Their Language:**
- **Legal:** "Compliance deadline" not "ElasticSearch tenant architecture"
- **Product:** "15% conversion uplift" not "ElasticSearch boost fields"
- **AWS Support:** "Audit trail of fraudulent resources" not "CloudTrail logs"

**Example:** Convinced AWS to cancel $500K by presenting evidence in business terms, not technical jargon.

### Technical Writing
**Documentation as a Force Multiplier:**
- RFCs for major architecture decisions (OneSearch, IAM)
- Audit trails for compliance (Brexit, FoodMesh hack)
- Runbooks for on-call engineers

**Standard:** If I'm the only person who understands a system, I've failed.

### Presenting to Leadership
**Executive Communication:**
- **VP All-Hands (Openlane):** AI moderation initiative recognized
- **AWS Consultants (FoodMesh):** Presented security recovery plan
- **Principal Engineer (H&B):** Defended TDD approach on OneSearch

**Skill:** Distill complexity to key decisions and trade-offs.
