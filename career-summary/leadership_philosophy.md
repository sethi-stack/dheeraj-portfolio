# Leadership Philosophy

## 1. Ownership & Accountability
I believe that **"you build it, you run it."** True ownership doesn't stop when the code is merged. It extends to monitoring in production, handling on-call incidents, and ensuring the feature delivers actual business value. I encourage teams to take pride in their craft and own the outcome, not just the output.

## 2. Bias for Action, but Not Chaos
In fast-paced environments (like startups or migrations), waiting for perfect information is a killer. I advocate for **reversible decisions** made quickly, while reserving deep deliberation for "one-way door" architectural choices. I value shipping small, incremental value over massive "big bang" releases.

## 3. Psychological Safety & Mentorship
A team that is afraid to fail is a team that stops innovating. I strive to create an environment where **"I don't know" is a valid answer**, and where mistakes are treated as learning opportunities (blameless post-mortems). I actively mentor junior engineers, not just on code, but on system thinking and career growth.

## 4. Pragmatism Over Dogma
Technology is a tool to solve business problems. I avoid "resume-driven development." Whether it's choosing a monolith over microservices for a startup, or picking a boring technology like SQL over a trendy NoSQL store, I prioritize **simplicity, maintainability, and business fit** over hype.
