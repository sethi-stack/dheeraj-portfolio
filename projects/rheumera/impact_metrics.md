# Impact & Metrics: Rheumera

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Business Growth
*   **Scaled to 60,000+ Patients:** The robust backend architecture enabled us to onboard 3 major clinic networks without performance degradation.
*   **50% Reduction in Review Time:** The AI-generated summaries allowed doctors to grasp a patient's weekly status in 30 seconds, down from 1-2 minutes of log reading.
*   **95% Billing Accuracy:** The automated time-tracker ensured that every billable minute was captured, directly increasing revenue for clinics.

### Technical Health
*   **80% Test Coverage:** Refactoring to SOLID principles allowed us to introduce a comprehensive JUnit test suite, reducing regression bugs to near zero.
*   **<500ms API Response:** Optimized SQL queries and frontend virtualization kept the dashboard snappy even for patients with years of history.
*   **Zero HIPAA Violations:** Strict RBAC and audit logging ensured 100% compliance during external security audits.

## 🏆 Leadership Wins
*   **Mentorship:** Mentored 2 junior developers who transitioned from "bug fixers" to owning full feature verticals (e.g., the "Patient Messaging" module).
*   **Process Improvement:** Introduced "RFCs" (Request for Comments) for major technical decisions, moving the team away from ad-hoc coding to deliberate design.
