# Project Overview: Rheumera (Remote Therapeutic Monitoring)

## 📝 Summary
Rheumera is a startup platform designed to improve rheumatology clinics through **Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM)**. As the **Lead Software Engineer**, I architected and built critical components of the platform, enabling clinics to monitor patient symptoms remotely and intervene earlier. I led the transition from a prototype to a scalable product serving 60,000+ patients, overseeing both frontend redesigns and backend architectural refactoring.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
*   **Clinical Blind Spots:** Rheumatologists lacked data on patient status between visits (often 3-6 months apart).
*   **Data Overload:** When data *was* collected, doctors were overwhelmed by raw logs and couldn't quickly identify at-risk patients.
*   **Scalability:** The initial MVP was monolithic and struggled to onboard new large clinics efficiently.

## 💼 Business Impact
*   **Scaled to 60K+ Patients:** The architectural improvements enabled the onboarding of major clinic networks.
*   **Faster Diagnosis:** Integrated OpenAI+Dall-E to summarize complex patient JSON data into visual graphs and text summaries, reducing doctor review time by 50%.
*   **Improved UX:** The ReactJS redesign of the Doctor's Portal led to higher adoption rates among non-technical clinical staff.

## 🔑 Key Technologies
*   **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Maven, Flyway
*   **Frontend:** ReactJS, TypeScript
*   **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFront), Docker, GitHub Actions
*   **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-4, Dall-E)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (RDS)
