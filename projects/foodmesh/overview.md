# Project Overview: FoodMesh Inc. (Food Recovery Platform)

## 📝 Summary
FoodMesh is a social impact platform that connects food businesses (farms, grocers) with charities to divert surplus food from landfills. As a **Software Consultant**, I built key components of the B2B marketplace and developed a geospatial visualization tool to track the flow of food donations across municipalities in BC and Manitoba.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
*   **Logistical Inefficiency:** Connecting a grocery store with 50kg of surplus tomatoes to a nearby soup kitchen was a manual, phone-based process.
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Municipalities funding these initiatives had no real-time data on how much food was being diverted or the carbon impact.
*   **Perishable Time Sensitivity:** Food expires quickly; the matching algorithm needed to find a recipient *fast*.

## 💼 Business Impact
*   **35 Million kg of Food Diverted:** The platform facilitated the recovery of enough food to provide **50 million meals** to those in need.
*   **96 Million kg CO2 Saved:** By keeping organic waste out of landfills, we significantly reduced methane emissions.
*   **Data-Driven Policy:** The visualization tools allowed city planners to see "food deserts" and allocate resources more effectively.

## 🔑 Key Technologies
*   **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
*   **Frontend:** ReactJS, Flutter (Mobile App), Google AppSheet
*   **Geospatial:** Google Maps API, PostGIS
*   **Messaging:** RabbitMQ (for async notifications)
