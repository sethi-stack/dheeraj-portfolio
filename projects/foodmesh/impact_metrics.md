# Impact & Metrics: FoodMesh

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Social & Environmental Impact
*   **35 Million kg of Food Diverted:** Directly facilitated the rescue of surplus food that would have otherwise gone to waste.
*   **50 Million Meals Provided:** The recovered food was distributed to food banks and charities, supporting food-insecure populations.
*   **96 Million kg CO2e Avoided:** By diverting organic waste from landfills, we prevented significant methane emissions (calculated using EPA standards).

### Platform Scale
*   **2,000+ Active Users:** Connected a network of farmers, grocers, and charities across Western Canada.
*   **$10M+ Value Recovered:** The financial value of the rescued food (tax receipts for donors) exceeded $10 million.

## 🏆 Engineering Wins
*   **Geospatial Optimization:** Reduced the "Find Nearby Charities" query time from 2 seconds to <50ms using PostGIS spatial indexing.
*   **Mobile Reliability:** The Flutter driver app maintained 99.9% crash-free sessions, critical for volunteers driving in remote areas with spotty internet.
